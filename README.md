<h1 align="center">Safe Travels Project</h1>
<h2 align="center">Project Goal of Analysis</h2>
<p>Based on a selected vacation destination, we want to create an interface that will recommend nearby trails as well as present weather data and corresponding outfit suggestions.</p>
<h2 align="center">Project Description and Findings</h2> 
<h2 align="center">Methodology</h2>
We are scraping data for the following information for this project:
<li>Daily weather for the top 50 visited cities in the United States (Average Temperature and Weather Description)</li>
<li>Prominent trails in and nearby the aforementioned cities</li>
<h2 align="center">Reproducibility</h2>
<h2 align="center">Limitations of Project</h2>
<li>We are only using information for the 50 most visited cities in the United States, so we are limiting the interface's responses to the data we are scraping from.</li>
<li>We are limiting our activities to that of trails, so more urban destinations might be limited in the number of trails that can be scraped and recommended.</li>
<h2 align="center">Extensions of Project</h2>
A good start for extending the model can be to include more cities in each state. The inclusion of all major cities in the United States can broaden the recommendations given for users of the interface for other trails. 
The inclusion of other outdoor activitues - such as parks, kayaking, and sports - can give users more variety what they could do in the city they select.
When scraping data on the NCEI, some of the data will not scrape due to certain issues with the website allowing all data to be scraped simultaneously.

<li>The cities we are using for this project were selected by this website as the top 50 travel destinations in the United States: https://www.aaa.com/tripcanvas/article/50-top-travel-destinations-in-the-us-CM534#methodology</li>
<li>The list of trails comes from AllTrails: https://www.alltrails.com/</li>
