<h1 align="center">Safe Travels Project</h1>
<h2 align="center">Project Goal of Analysis</h2>
<p align="center">Based on a selected vacation destination, we want to create an interface that will recommend nearby trails as well as present weather data and corresponding outfit suggestions.</p>
<h2 align="center">Project Description and Findings</h2> 
<h2 align="center">Methodology</h2>
<h2 align="center">Limitations of Project</h2>
<li align="center">We are only using information for the 50 most visited cities in the United States, so we are limiting the interface's responses to the data we are scraping from.</li>
<li align="center">We are limiting our activities to that of trails, so more urban destinations might be limited in the number of trails that can be scraped and recommended.</li>
<h2 align="center">Extensions of Project</h2>
<h2 align="center">Sources of Datatsets</h2>
<li align="center">The cities we are using for this project were selected by this website as the top 50 travel destinations in the United States: https://www.aaa.com/tripcanvas/article/50-top-travel-destinations-in-the-us-CM534#methodology</li>
